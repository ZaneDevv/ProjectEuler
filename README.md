# Project Euler

[`Project euler`](https://projecteuler.net/) is a set of exercises that mix maths and programming skills. Here there are all kind of exercises, from the easiest one to the heardest.

Sometimes I make some of them in order to train my skills and learn something new.

I completed until the 14th exercise so far, but the goal here is keep completing exercises.
